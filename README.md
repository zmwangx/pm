*Man page editing made less painful.*

## Prerequisites

- A C++11 compiler;
- A POSIX system with `man(1)`;
- Python 3.3 or later;
- A modern web browser with support for server-sent events
  ([no Microsoft for you!](http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource)).

Optional:

- [`py-setproctitle`](https://github.com/dvarrazzo/py-setproctitle) â€” used to set the server process title to `pmserver`, useful for monitoring server status (otherwise, the process will have a generic title `python`).
